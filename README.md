# 🧪 Open-Source Plastic Lab  
*An off-grid-ready, low-cost plastic processing facility designed for post-collapse innovation, forest tinkerers, and community-scale sustainability.*

> “Don’t wait for the system to fix itself. Build a better one in your garage.”

## 🔧 What This Is

This repository contains a **complete 30-day build plan** to create your own modular plastic processing lab. All tools, systems, and workflows are open-source and optimized for:

- 🛠️ **Low cost** ($1,800–$2,750)
- 🌲 **Off-grid operation**
- ♻️ **Recycling, repurposing, and fuel creation**
- 🧠 **Practical empowerment over theory**

Build it in a single garage. Power it with solar. Run it with just your hands and a few scavenged microwaves.
