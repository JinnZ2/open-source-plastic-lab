#  Open-Source Plastic Lab  
*An off-grid-ready, low-cost plastic processing facility designed for innovation, forest tinkerers, and community-scale sustainability.*

> “Don’t wait for the system to fix itself. Build a better one in your garage.”

##  What This Is

This repository contains a **complete 30-day build plan** to create your own modular plastic processing lab. All tools, systems, and workflows are open-source and optimized for:

-  **Low cost** ($1,800–$2,750)
-  **Off-grid operation**
-  **Recycling, repurposing, and fuel creation**
-  **Practical empowerment over theory**

Build it in a single garage. Power it with solar. Run it with just your hands and a few scavenged microwaves.

##  The 30-Day Build Plan

Each week focuses on a system. Each step is fully documented.

- **Week 1**: Build cleaner, shredder, and extruder
- **Week 2**: Pyrolysis and mold press
- **Week 3**: Chemical + carbon systems
- **Week 4**: Integration, optimization, launch
