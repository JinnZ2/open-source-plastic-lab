# Safety Protocols — Forest Plastic Lab Water Systems

**This isn't just DIY — it's high-voltage, high-pressure, chemical-reactive DIY. Treat it like science, not arts and crafts.**

## 🔥 High Priority Warnings

- **⚡ Electricity:** Some systems involve >200V. Use insulated gloves, GFCI outlets, and don't test near puddles.
- **☢️ Chemical Reactions:** Hydrogen peroxide + UV = hydroxyl radicals = destroy-all-things mode. Use goggles and ventilation.
- **🔥 Pyrolysis:** Flammable vapors. Always operate outdoors or in fireproof fume hoods.
- **💀 Gases:** Some stages may release hydrogen, CO, or VOCs. Install a CO detector.
- **💧 Water + Electric = BAD:** Every water-facing system must be sealed, grounded, and disconnected before servicing.

## 🧰 Required Safety Gear

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Goggles (UV-rated)** | Eye protection from UV-C and flying sludge |
| **Heat-resistant gloves** | For reactors, mold press, hot plates |
| **Respirator (organic vapor)** | Chemical fumes, pyrolysis gases |
| **Rubber apron** | Protect from acid/base splash |
| **Fire extinguisher (ABC)** | One per 100 sq ft minimum |
| **Ventilation fan** | Every system needs one |
| **CO detector** | Required for pyrolysis or plasma setups |
| **First aid kit** | Not optional. Bandages won't grow in the woods. |

## 🛑 Red Flags

- If it smells like burning plastic and you're *not* doing pyrolysis: shut it down.
- If the voltage seems “weird”: use a multimeter, not your fingers.
- If your Arduino starts smoking: stop invoking forest spirits via serial port.
- If water appears where it shouldn’t: power off, mop up, curse loudly.

Stay alive, we need you.
