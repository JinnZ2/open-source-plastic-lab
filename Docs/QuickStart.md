# QuickStart — Build the Electrocoagulation Unit in 1 Day

> You’ll make your first real water treatment device by sundown, even with forest squirrels judging you.

---

## ⏱️ Estimated Build Time: 4–6 hours

---

## 🧱 Materials Needed (from BOM)

- 10L clear tank
- 6 aluminum plates
- DC power supply (12–30V)
- Air pump & diffuser
- PVC pipe & glue
- Timer relay
- Wires, clips, screws

---

## 🔧 Tools Needed

- Drill + bits
- Soldering iron or crimp connectors
- Hot glue or silicone
- Screwdriver
- Multimeter (strongly recommended)

---

## 🛠️ Build Steps

1. **Cut aluminum plates** to 6×8" if not pre-cut.
2. **Drill lid of tank** for wire entry and air tubing.
3. **Slot aluminum plates vertically** inside tank, alternating + / -.
4. **Wire in series-parallel** so polarity alternates:
   `[ + - + - + - ]`
5. **Seal wires through tank lid** with silicone or grommets.
6. **Install air stone** at bottom for agitation.
7. **Wire power supply** to outermost plates (12–24V to start).
8. **Add water + test!** Bubbles = good. Flocculation = success.

## ✅ Test Parameters

| Parameter | Range |
|----------|--------|
| Voltage | 12–24V |
| Current density | 10–50 mA/cm² |
| pH | 6.5–7.5 |
| Time | 20–45 minutes |

---

## 🧪 Output

- Microplastics clump at surface or bottom
- Water clarifies by 70–95%
- Sludge can be filtered, dried, reused
- Water reused in wash cycle

---

## 👁️ Monitor

- Use pH strips
- Visual clarity (before/after photos!)
- Sludge thickness
- Plate corrosion (clean monthly)

Congratulations. You now have a **working industrial water remediation device** that fits on a bench.

Be impressed with yourself.
