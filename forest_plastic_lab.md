# Complete Forest Plastic Processing Lab - Build Plan

## Your 30-Day Journey: From Zero to Full Production

### Overview: The Integrated System

Building all 6 systems creates a complete plastic processing lab where each system feeds the others:

- **Cleaning station** → prepares all plastics
- **Sorter/shredder** → feeds all other systems
- **Filament maker** → highest value for clean plastics
- **Pyrolysis unit** → handles dirty/mixed plastics
- **Chemical recovery** → processes PET specifically
- **Carbon converter** → uses waste from other processes
- **Mold press** → uses any plastic type

**Total investment:** $1,800-2,750
**Potential daily revenue:** $100-500
**Space needed:** Single garage or 200 sq ft
